# CSharpScript.Console

A lightweight interactive C# scripting console designed for real-time execution of C# code. This project is based on **C#Script**, allowing developers to dynamically interact with the host program using native C# syntax, without the need to recompile the entire project. It offers flexibility for rapid prototyping and testing.
